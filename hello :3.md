Hiiiii!

I'm dfang5. I'm the creator of Fortune Bot. Nice meeting you! 

I figured there should be a file in which I should express myself in, because, you know, I wasn't able to do this in the other files.

This bot started off as a simple economy bot on discord almost a year ago, with only 48 lines of code. It wasn't even intended to go this far. I made so much progress on it that it's barely recognizable from when I started working on it. 

Back then it could only track money and artefacts, and guess what, it didn't even have a database. as a result, all data would delete when the bot restarted, frustrating a lot of people. 

It wasn't until I added a banking system that I additionally coded in a database. 

I'm proud of what I did. Fortune bot has grown into a big community with future expansions planned everywhere, with a garagantuan 4258 lines of code including 150,000 characters.

Because of that I can confidently say that if you put the effort in to create anything, frankly, you will get all the credit back depending on how much you put.

Try it. It'll surprise you. 

Thank you to all your suggestions. I couldn't have done it without you guys.

Anyway, this is a short note from me. And also, thank you, Yuchuff, for giving me the whole idea for this. 

I'll sign off now. Thank you again for your support, and I'll see you again in the next commit!
